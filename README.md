# Sunkenland Mod Template

Welcome to the Sunkenland Mod Template by Azumatt! This repository provides a .NET template for quickly scaffolding mods
for Sunkenland.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version you're targeting, e.g., .NET 5.0 or later)
- Git
- JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio (optional for GUI-based installation)

## Features
- This mod template automatically packages your mod into a .zip file when in Release mode for Thunderstore as well as Nexus.
- The contents of the zip file come from the Thunderstore folder. Make sure you're updating the `manifest.json` with your relevant information for Thunderstore.
- The README.md at the project root is auto copied to the Thunderstore folder, to keep both the same and auto-packaging a breeze.
- The zip files will auto append the version string when you change the version in the `Plugin.cs` file and places it inside of the project's Thunderstore/Nexus folders (respectively).
- A copy of the compiled mods will be placed in your specified output folders from the `environment.props` file.
- It also includes a .gitignore file for use with Git.
